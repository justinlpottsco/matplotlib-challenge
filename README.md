Observations:
1) While Capomulin may be the drug of interest, Ramicane appears to be a slightly better regiement with lower Mean and Median tumor size over the course study. 
2) Both Capomulin and Ramicane were the most utilized treatments on the mice.
3) The sex of the mice under study was almost 50/50 male vs. female, which helps mitigate potentia outliers due to sex.
